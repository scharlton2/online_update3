"Cartesian Grid for NaysEddy" is a Cartesian grid generator for the solver "NaysEddy". This engine generates Cartesian grids on arbitrary topography. The bed topography can be selected from the library, or can be defined by the user via an input file. The input file includes a uniform Cartesian grid with nodes coordinates and bed elevation (on nodes), but the resolution of the grid is not necessary to be equal to the final grid.
