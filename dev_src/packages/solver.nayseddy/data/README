"NaysEddy" is a three-dimensional solver for calculation of unsteady flows using Cartesian coordinates. It solved the complex geometries in a rubost way by using ghost-cell immersed boundary techniques. The solver is based on full Navier-Stokes equations and apply large-eddy simulation (LES) as turbulence closure. Since NaysEddy is a fully three-dimensional large-eddy simulation model, it generally requires more CPU time than two-dimensional models and models based on RANS. Although this engine is basically not suitable for computations of large reach of rivers, it will become a powerful tool to analyze detailed structures of flows with local or segment scales in rivers.
